### 0. Lexical scoping and welcome message
          mandatory         Progress vs Score  Task Body Create a function named   ` welcome `  :
* It takes two arguments:  ` firstName `  (string) and  ` lastName `  (string)
* It contains a variable named  ` fullName ` , that will contains the  ` firstName `  followed by a space and then the  ` lastName ` 
* Within the  ` welcome `  function, write a function named  ` displayFullName ` :* It should display an alert with the message  ` Welcome `  + the variable  ` fullName `  + and exclamation mark.

* Call the function  ` displayFullName `  at the end of the function  ` welcome ` 
How to test
* Open your web inspector in the tab “Console”
* Copy paste your code
* Run  ` welcome('Holberton', 'School'); `  should prompt an alert with this content:  ` Welcome Holberton School! ` 
*  ` alert(fullName) ` , should return a reference error  ` fullName is not defined `
